I created a website about myself. The website talks about the things I do which include Photography and Web development.
The aim of the website is to tell the viewers about me and my services and gives them an opportunity to contact me if needed.
There are four pages, all linked to one another from every page.

Home page:
This gives an overview of who I am and what I do. I used this as an opportunity to pratice inpage links, image tags, bootstrap grid model and css elements, as well as other css properties and selectors. There is a call top action button on the page, so the user can decide to learn about me on the first page and contact me if needed withouthaving to go to other pages to get information.

About page:
This page basically talks about me and gives the viewer quick information about my past and interest. I used this page to practice ordered lists, bootstrap responsive feature and @media query to change styling for smaller screens.

Services page:
This page shows the viewer what I do at a glance. This page was also used to practive @media query for small screen styling and table creation and design. After creating the table, I decided to also add some table bootstrap styling to make it look better.

Contact page:
This page gives the viewer an opportunity to contact me. @media query was used here as well for small screen styling. I also created a form for users to contact me. The form triggers a 'mailto' action so you can email me.

Style.scss:
This scss file was basically my css file before I addess sass variables, nestind and inheritance, which came in real handy when dealing with the @media queries for 3 pages.
